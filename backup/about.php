<div class="about-me-right-side">
<p class="first-paragraph">Art has always played an important role in my life. I played the piano, violin and harp as a child and spent most of my spare time with my nose in a book. As a teenager, I loved taking photographs with my SLR and developing them in the darkroom.</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">I studied politics then social health at university, with a particular interest in human rights.</p>

<h3 class="about-me-subheading">LAMPWORKING & SILVERSMITHING</h3>

<p>In 2006, a friend introduced me to lampworking. I knew nothing about jewellery at the time but I was fascinated by hot glass and hooked from the moment I melted my first rod.</p>

<p>Later that week, I bought my first little torch, a hothead, and a few basic tools and rods of glass and set up a small studio at home. That small studio grew as I acquired more glass and tools and moved on to more powerful torches.</p>

<p>I find hot glass mesmerising and love playing with it and trying to get colours to react in different ways. The array of reactions you can get from a single rod of silver-rich glass is astonishing and depends on so many variables - the temperature of the flame, the chemical makeup of the flame, the kiln environment, the types of tools used to manipulate the glass (brass vs graphite etc)...</p>

<p>Like so many artists/craftspeople, I first began selling my work as a way to fund my hobby but after a while my business became quite successful.
Unfortunately, in late 2010, I had to give up lampworking due to ill health. Since then, I've been back to university to study computer science.</p>

<p>From the time I started lampworking, I had wanted to try silversmithing and I was finally able to do beginners and intermediate courses at the incredible <a href="http://www.jamfactory.com.au/" target="_blank">Jam Factory</a> in Adelaide. </p>

<p>I get a great sense of satisfaction from the process of turning a pile of raw materials into something (hopefully) beautiful and/or useful.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my work!</p>
